- **Onboarding** is a comprehensive process that socializes new employees to the organization and ensures they have the necessary skills and knowledge to become effective members.

Each phase has specific goals and activities designed to help the employee become fully integrated into the organization. The document recommends having a performance discussion at the end of the first year to review progress and set goals for the future."
Who is responsible for onboarding in an organization?,"The document clearly states: **""Onboarding is the responsibility of the entire organization, not just HR or the manager/supervisor!""**

What's the difference between orientation and onboarding?,"According to the document, onboarding and orientation are NOT the same. Orientation might occur on the first day or during the first week to introduce new hires to policies and procedures. In contrast, onboarding is a process that socializes new employees to the organization and ensures they have the necessary skills and knowledge to become effective members of the organization."
Why should organizations evaluate their onboarding process?,"According to the document, evaluating the onboarding process is essential for continuous improvement. It helps organizations know what works and what needs to change so that the onboarding process will be even better for the next new hire. The document includes a sample onboarding evaluation that covers how employees feel about their experience and what they know about the organization and their job."
"What is the significance of the biblical quote in the document: ""And you shall not oppress a stranger...""?","The document includes the biblical quote: ""And you shall not oppress a stranger, for you know the feelings of the stranger, since you were strangers in the land of Egypt"" (Exodus 23:9). This quote appears to emphasize the importance of welcoming newcomers with empathy and understanding. In the context of onboarding, it suggests that organizations should be mindful of the experience of new employees (""strangers"") and ensure they feel welcomed and supported, not overwhelmed or oppressed."
What is the role of a buddy in the onboarding process?,"According to the document, a buddy plays a supportive role in the onboarding process. The buddy should not be the new hire's direct manager and should be at a comparable level of seniority. They can give the new hire a tour, provide informal guidance, and help them get acclimated to the workplace. The document recommends introducing new hires to their buddies on the first day and giving them an opportunity to spend some time together. If job shadowing is an option, having the new hire shadow their buddy can help them get an idea of what their days may look like and form a deeper connection."
What kind of paperwork should be prepared for new employees?,"# Paperwork for New Employees

The document suggests the following paperwork may be needed for new employees:

1. I-9 form (requiring valid forms of ID)
2. W-4 form
3. Personal data form
4. Code of conduct certification
5. Personnel manual
6. Direct deposit form (requiring a voided check)
7. Signed offer letter
8. Other organization-specific requirements (e.g., nondisclosure agreement, photo release, etc.)

The document advises sending some or all of this paperwork electronically (if they can sign electronically) or physically (if they must physically sign it) before the first day. However, it cautions not to overwhelm new employees and to save complicated paperwork for the first week."
What should be included in a sample first day schedule?,"# Sample First Day Schedule

The document provides the following sample schedule for a new employee's first day:

- **9:30 AM**: Arrival
- **9:35 AM**: Review the day's schedule
- **9:50 AM**: Meet buddy and take a tour
- **10:35 AM**: See workspace
- **10:45 AM**: Organizational overview
- **12:00 PM**: LUNCH
- **1:00 PM**: Meet HR and finish paperwork
- **2:00 PM**: Department head meet-and-greet
- **3:00 PM**: Set up workspace
- **4:00 PM**: Supervisor check-in
- **5:00 PM**: Departure"
How should organizations handle safety and harassment policies during onboarding?,"According to the document, organizations should address safety and harassment policies in several ways during onboarding:

1. During the first day, HR should discuss all policies and procedures related to safety at work, including sexual harassment

2. Those coming into jobs that are at a higher risk for harassment (e.g., development roles, leadership roles, manager roles) should be briefed on the organization's written policies and procedures for reporting and addressing potential issues

3. All new hires should be reminded of when they are scheduled to participate in sexual harassment training

4. During the first week, formal training in workplace safety should be provided to demonstrate the importance of workplace safety

5. After the first 90 days, organizations should continue the discussion about the importance of feeling safe at work and reinforce the commitment to creating a workplace that feels safe for everyone

The document emphasizes that the key to developing an organizational culture where harassment is rare is to immediately establish with all new employees that safety is a top priority and that unacceptable actions will be addressed immediately."
What's the most important aspect of preparing for a new employee's first day?,"According to the document, ""The most important aspect of preparing for the first day is to communicate with and engage your new employees, and to prepare your organization for their arrival. You want your new employees to be excited and confident in their decision to join your organization and to feel set up for success. It is equally important that your current employees feel prepared and eager to welcome their new colleagues."""
What are some creative ideas for welcoming new employees?,"# Creative Welcome Ideas for New Employees

The document shares several creative ideas for welcoming new employees:

- Placing a bright flag on their desk that says ""Say hi! It's my first week here"" to encourage coworkers to introduce themselves
- Adding a desk plant, welcome sign, signed card, box of candy, or personalized mug with the organization's logo to their workspace
- Providing a gift certificate to a local restaurant or coffee shop in their top drawer as a surprise
- Setting a budget and letting them order any office supplies they want beyond the usual items
- Framing their business card with a note saying ""We're thrilled you're here!""
- Having them answer a fun survey about themselves (with questions like ""What was your most creative Purim/Halloween costume?"") and then including a version of their bio based on these answers in the weekly staff email

These personal touches help make new employees feel welcomed and valued from their first day."
What two main ways does successful onboarding benefit an organization?,"According to the document, successful and effective onboarding benefits the organization in two main ways:

1. **Saves money** – Hiring, training, and functioning at less than 100 percent adds up. Having new employees leave after a few months wastes valuable company resources. Organizations save money when onboarding is efficient and successful.

2. **Maximizes productivity** – Hiring new employees, training them, and waiting for them to figure things out is inefficient. It is in the organization's best interest to have an onboarding process that minimizes time spent learning the ropes."
