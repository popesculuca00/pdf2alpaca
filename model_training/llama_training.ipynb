If an employee is absent for three or more consecutive days due to illness or injury, a doctor's note may be required.

Qualifying reasons for FMLA leave include: the birth and care of a newborn child; placement with the employee of a child for adoption or foster care; care for an immediate family member (spouse, child, or parent) with a serious health condition; medical leave when the employee is unable to work because of a serious health condition; or qualifying exigencies arising out of a family member's military service. Additionally, the Bank offers a Parental Leave benefit beyond FMLA. Following the birth or adoption of a child, eligible employees who have been employed for at least one year may receive four weeks of paid parental leave. The paid parental leave runs concurrently with FMLA leave. During FMLA leave, the Bank will maintain the employee's health coverage under the group health plan, and upon return from FMLA leave, most employees must be restored to their original or equivalent positions with equivalent pay, benefits, and other employment terms.

The performance evaluation process is designed to: provide feedback on job performance; recognize achievements and contributions; identify strengths and areas for improvement; establish goals and expectations for the coming year; and determine merit increase eligibility. The evaluation process begins with employees completing a self-assessment of their performance, accomplishments, and goals. Supervisors then complete an evaluation form assessing the employee's performance in key areas such as job knowledge, quality of work, productivity, dependability, communication skills, teamwork, and initiative. The supervisor and employee meet to discuss the evaluation, with both parties having the opportunity to provide input. During the meeting, they establish specific, measurable goals for the upcoming year that align with department and Bank objectives. Performance ratings typically include: Exceeds Expectations, Meets Expectations, Partially Meets Expectations, and Does Not Meet Expectations. In addition to annual reviews, supervisors are encouraged to provide ongoing feedback throughout the year, including informal check-ins and mid-year progress reviews. Performance evaluations become part of the employee's personnel file and are considered when making decisions about promotions, transfers, and compensation adjustments.

Qualifying reasons for FMLA leave include: the birth and care of a newborn child; placement with the employee of a child for adoption or foster care; care for an immediate family member (spouse, child, or parent) with a serious health condition; medical leave when the employee is unable to work because of a serious health condition; or qualifying exigencies arising out of a family member's military service. Additionally, the Bank offers a Parental Leave benefit beyond FMLA. Following the birth or adoption of a child, eligible employees who have been employed for at least one year may receive four weeks of paid parental leave. The paid parental leave runs concurrently with FMLA leave. During FMLA leave, the Bank will maintain the employee's health coverage under the group health plan, and upon return from FMLA leave, most employees must be restored to their original or equivalent positions with equivalent pay, benefits, and other employment terms. Employees should provide 30 days' advance notice of the need to take FMLA leave when it is foreseeable and should promptly notify the Human Resources Department to request family leave."

To be eligible for holiday pay, employees must be in an active pay status the workday before and after the holiday. Regular full-time employees receive 8 hours of pay for each observed holiday. Regular part-time employees who work at least 20 hours per week receive holiday pay prorated based on their regular work schedule. If an eligible non-exempt employee is required to work on an observed holiday, the employee will receive holiday pay plus pay for the hours worked at one and one-half times their regular rate.

         "What is First National Bank's policy on performance evaluations?",
         "First National Bank conducts formal performance evaluations for all employees on an annual basis, typically around the employee's employment anniversary date. The performance evaluation process is designed to: provide feedback on job performance; recognize achievements and contributions; identify strengths and areas for improvement; establish goals and expectations for the coming year; and determine merit increase eligibility. The evaluation process begins with employees completing a self-assessment of their performance, accomplishments, and goals. Supervisors then complete an evaluation form assessing the employee's performance in key areas such as job knowledge, quality of work, productivity, dependability, communication skills, teamwork, and initiative. The supervisor and employee meet to discuss the evaluation, with both parties having the opportunity to provide input. During the meeting, they establish specific, measurable goals for the upcoming year that align with department and Bank objectives. Performance ratings typically include: Exceeds Expectations, Meets Expectations, Partially Meets Expectations, and Does Not Meet Expectations. In addition to annual reviews, supervisors are encouraged to provide ongoing feedback throughout the year, including informal check-ins and mid-year progress reviews. Performance evaluations become part of the employee's personnel file and are considered when making decisions about promotions, transfers, and compensation adjustments. Employees who disagree with their performance evaluation may submit a written response that will be attached to the evaluation in their personnel file."

         "First National Bank is committed to providing a safe, healthy, and productive work environment that is free from the effects of substance abuse. The Bank prohibits the use, possession, sale, transfer, or distribution of illegal drugs or controlled substances while on Bank premises, while operating Bank vehicles or equipment, or while conducting Bank business. The Bank also prohibits the unauthorized use or abuse of alcohol on Bank premises or while conducting Bank business. Employees are prohibited from reporting to work or remaining at work when under the influence of alcohol, illegal drugs, or controlled substances. Legal medications or prescription drugs that may affect an employee's ability to safely perform their job should be reported to the supervisor or Human Resources. The Bank may conduct drug and alcohol testing in the following situations: pre-employment screening for certain positions; reasonable suspicion of substance abuse; after workplace accidents resulting in injury or significant property damage; randomly for employees in safety-sensitive positions; and as required by law. Testing positive for illegal drugs or alcohol, refusing to submit to testing, or adulterating test samples will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. The Bank encourages employees with substance abuse problems to seek assistance through the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) or other treatment resources before their job performance is affected. Self-referral to treatment will not adversely affect an employee's job or career, but participation in a treatment program will not protect an employee from disciplinary action for policy violations."

This includes: physical assault, fighting, or intimidation; verbal threats, threatening language, or gestures; possession of weapons on Bank premises (except where permitted by law and authorized by the Bank); vandalism, arson, or sabotage; and any other behavior that causes others to feel unsafe.
